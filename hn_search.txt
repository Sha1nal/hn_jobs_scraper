      "story_text": "I\u2019m 29. I manage a small team of engineers who hate what they do. Even I don\u2019t enjoy what I do. Together, we support a platform that\u2019s is trying to be replaced. But supporting it sucks.<p>For the past two years I\u2019ve been looking for a new job, something that makes me use my thinking skills and be appreciated for it. I haven\u2019t got that. Each group of interviews yields problems for me:<p>* whilst I can code, I don\u2019t do it often. I\u2019m rusty and sometimes that shows. More often than not, I\u2019m reading code and trying to find bugs in that code or fixing them. So late in an interview with a hedge fund for a reliability engineering role was i asked to write an in memory database that could handle SQL commands.. well ok, but that\u2019s not representative of anything I\u2019ve ever done (or would do). But an hour to build it the way I want to? Not enough time. Next I was asked about heaps etc (by using an example algorithm), again stuff I know about but because I never write things from scratch anymore, I suck at it. I\u2019ve been coding more in my free time, but I\u2019m beginning to resent it. It\u2019s no longer a passion of mine as it once used to be. Every time I start to commit to writing code that I don\u2019t need to do, I am reminded of prior interview failures I\u2019ve had. As a reliability engineer, I guess I have to know everything? I don\u2019t know everything, and I\u2019m ok with that fact. Maybe I\u2019m just not cut out for it.<p>* system design and troubleshooting and unix skills? Great. I love that. Interview feedback was strong here.<p>* I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m good at? Interviewed for an EM role at the start of the year. Got through the panels and the HM was super enthusiastic. Final role with someone more senior. Failed at that level: feedback was that I didn\u2019t have the right strategy\u2026 yielded in 30 mins? Ok then. Feedback wasn\u2019t super useful but the recruiter let me know the HM was fighting for me.<p>So I\u2019ve been in my current role for just under a year now and I can\u2019t say I\u2019m growing much. The work is demanding and I don\u2019t have enough people to support the workload. They\u2019re also quite junior in their careers.

          "value": "I\u2019m 29. I manage a small team of engineers <em>who</em> hate what they do. Even I don\u2019t enjoy what I do. Together, we support a platform that\u2019s <em>is</em> trying to be replaced. But supporting it sucks.<p>For the past two years I\u2019ve been looking for a new job, something that makes me use my thinking skills and be appreciated for it. I haven\u2019t got that. Each group of interviews yields problems for me:<p>* whilst I can code, I don\u2019t do it often. I\u2019m rusty and sometimes that shows. More often than not, I\u2019m reading code and trying to find bugs in that code or fixing them. So late in an interview with a hedge fund for a reliability engineering role was i asked to write an in memory database that could handle SQL commands.. well ok, but that\u2019s not representative of anything I\u2019ve ever done (or would do). But an hour to build it the way I want to? Not enough time. Next I was asked about heaps etc (by using an example algorithm), again stuff I know about but because I never write things from scratch anymore, I suck at it. I\u2019ve been coding more in my free time, but I\u2019m beginning to resent it. It\u2019s no longer a passion of mine as it once used to be. Every time I start to commit to writing code that I don\u2019t need to do, I am reminded of prior interview failures I\u2019ve had. As a reliability engineer, I guess I have to know everything? I don\u2019t know everything, and I\u2019m ok with that fact. Maybe I\u2019m just not cut out for it.<p>* system design and troubleshooting and unix skills? Great. I love that. Interview feedback was strong here.<p>* I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m good at? Interviewed for an EM role at the start of the year. Got through the panels and the HM was super enthusiastic. Final role with someone more senior. Failed at that level: feedback was that I didn\u2019t have the right strategy\u2026 yielded in 30 mins? Ok then. Feedback wasn\u2019t super useful but the recruiter let me know the HM was fighting for me.<p>So I\u2019ve been in my current role for just under a year now and I can\u2019t say I\u2019m growing much. The work <em>is</em> demanding and I don\u2019t have enough people to support the workload. They\u2019re also quite junior in their careers.
